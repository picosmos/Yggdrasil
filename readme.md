## Name

> In Norse mythology, Heimdallr (Hǫrgr Heimdallr, anglicized Heimdall) is described as the watchman of the gods.
> 
> He lives at Himinbjörg (“Heaven’s Cliffs” or “Sky Cliffs”), which is located right at the end of Bifröst, the rainbow bridge connecting Midgard (the world of humans) with Asgard (the realm of the gods).
> 
> Snorri Sturluson in the Prose Edda (Gylfaginning, ch. 27) writes:
> 
> “He dwells in a place called Himinbjörg, at the bridge’s end where Bifröst joins heaven.”
> 
> From there Heimdall keeps watch for the approach of giants and other threats. He has extraordinary senses (he can hear grass grow and see for hundreds of leagues), and when Ragnarok begins, he will blow his great horn Gjallarhorn to summon the gods.
> 
> Do you want me to also summarize the sources in the Poetic Edda, or are you mainly interested in Snorri’s account?

## We need a port

> A good five-digit number that relates to Heimdallr’s home Himinbjörg could be taken from the Old Norse verse reference in the Prose Edda.
> 
> In Gylfaginning (chapter 27), Snorri describes Heimdallr’s dwelling at the bridge’s end.
> If we take 27 (the chapter number) and pair it with the year of Snorri’s birth, 1179, we get:
> 
> 27179
> 
> That way, the number encodes both the textual source (chapter 27) and Snorri, who preserved the myth.
